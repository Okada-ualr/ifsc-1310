            <p>Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's 
            space program. <em>Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, five of 
            whom went by the name of Albert.</em></p>

            <p>Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from
            Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space. Even though he was weightless 
            for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his 
            journey into space. Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that
            the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a 
            modest slowing of his pulse.</p>
            
            <p>Definition of Terms:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Cape Canaveral</dt>
                <dd>A cape in Brevard County, Florida, in the United States, near 
                    the center of the state's Atlantic coast.</dd>

                <dt>Nasa</dt>
                <dd>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration. An 
                independent agency of the U.S. federal government responsible for 
                the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and space 
                research</dd>

            <h3>The Mission</h3>

            <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile 
            Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had ever travelled 
            before - <strong>over 1,500 miles</strong> - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before 
            returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south
            of Cape Canaveral.</p>

            <blockquote><q>We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. 
            Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a
            man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's
            work.</q>  <cite>Deke Slayton, Mercury Seven Astronaut</cite></blockquote>
            
            <h4>The Jupiter AM-13</h4>

            <p>The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the 
            US Army as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken 
            over and deployed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United
            States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.</p>

            <h3>The Journey</h3>

            <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall.
            The space suit was fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones 
            which recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered one of the outstanding 
            achievements of space research.</p>
