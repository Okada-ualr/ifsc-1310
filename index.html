        <h2>Dragon Project Revision & Reflection</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        I have learned in this course, especially in the Dragon project, that styling is difficult without a strong foundational structure and proper color/font schemes and css structure.  I believe I did fairly well in terms of the base html structure, but my CSS styling could have been more organized.  I failed to document color schemes, font styles and font sizes, and also was not being consistent with units such as %, vw, px, rem etc. 
      </p>

      <p>
        If I were to start over, I would change the way I organize the color/font scheme.  Since I used a try and error approach when applying colors and fonts, it was hard to keep track of the styling of various elements and maintain consistency throughout the website.  I would also like to make the website responsive with flexbox and media queries.
      </p>

      <h3>Feedbacks</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>The questions and answers in the FAQ page are hard to differentiate because they have the same font and their sizes are similar.</dt>
        <dd>Made the answers collapsible with Jquery so that the answers are hidden until the questions are clicked.</dd>
        
        <dt>The texts in the footer (#colophon) should be spaced out.</dt>
        <dd>Applied white-space: pre; to the h6 element containing the texts.</dd>

        <dt>The color scheme for the table in History page looks out of place.</dt>
        <dd>Changed styling to match the theme of the page, but I'm not sure if it's improved.</dd>

        <dt>The nav elements should indicate which page the user is currently on.</dt>
        <dd>Added an id "viewing" to the corresponding < a > tag for each page to add styles indicating which page the user is visiting.</dd>

        <h2>Thoughts on Prograssive Enhancement</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Progressive Enhancement is a content-oriented, layered and bottom-up approach to developing a website.  The primary purpose of this design philosophy is to create a website that is universally accessible to users with varying degree of browser support.  For example, a website that relies heavily on modern javascript features to function may not be usable for users with older browsers.  Progressive Enhancement methodology avoids this problem by starting the development with solid, descriptive HTML that works as the foundation to all other additional features.  Once there is a strong foundation, the developers may begin adding more features (enhancements) to the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a business point of view, Progressive Enhancement is important in modern web development because people browse the internet on many devices with varying degree of capabilities, and having accessible website is not only an ethical requirement but is also a key factor in the discoverability and reputation of your business.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a devoloperâ€™s point of view, Progressive Enhancement offers greater stability and maintainability because develoeprs ensure the foundation is rock-solid before adding any features, and therefore less patching is required just to support every browser that exists.
