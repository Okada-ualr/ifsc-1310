        <h2>Dragon Project Revision & Reflection</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        In this assignment I ask that you collect feedback from a peer, family member, or a friend on your first attempt at the Dragon or Segway project. Using that feedback, I'd like you to attempt to address any issues or problems pointed out by your potential users. You should provide a link to the revised project (duplicate the directory in aws and then add a link to the revised project (see above). You should also provide several paragraphs reflecting on the learning experience working on this project and your experience during the semester. What were the things you did well? What would you do differently if you had to startover? Also report on the feedback you received and what you did to address those issues or why you chose not to make the recommended changes.

        <h2>Thoughts on Prograssive Enhancement</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Progressive Enhancement is a content-oriented, layered and bottom-up approach to developing a website.  The primary purpose of this design philosophy is to create a website that is universally accessible to users with varying degree of browser support.  For example, a website that relies heavily on modern javascript features to function may not be usable for users with older browsers.  Progressive Enhancement methodology avoids this problem by starting the development with solid, descriptive HTML that works as the foundation to all other additional features.  Once there is a strong foundation, the developers may begin adding more features (enhancements) to the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a business point of view, Progressive Enhancement is important in modern web development because people browse the internet on many devices with varying degree of capabilities, and having accessible website is not only an ethical requirement but is also a key factor in the discoverability and reputation of your business.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a devoloperâ€™s point of view, Progressive Enhancement offers greater stability and maintainability because develoeprs ensure the foundation is rock-solid before adding any features, and therefore less patching is required just to support every browser that exists.
